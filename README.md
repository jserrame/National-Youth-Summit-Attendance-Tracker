Calculating the number Zoom sessions that attendees fully attended

* Along with 6 other Youth Co-Chairs and 4 managers, we organized and hosted the 2nd National Youth Summit on April 23-24, 2021 via the platform Pathable. 
* Over 500 registered for the event, and the total session engagement was 1487. We wanted to award the attendee who attended the most number of Zoom sessions fully
but the data exported from Pathable was quite messy.
* I did some data cleaning and wrangling on the data to help my manager pick the winner. The winner was Gurmm S who fully attended 15 out of 15 sessions
